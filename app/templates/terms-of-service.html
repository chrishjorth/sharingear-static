 style='color:#262626'>
</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>As a User,
you may create Gear profiles. To create a Gear profile, you will be asked a
variety of questions about the Equipment to be listed, including but not
limited to a description, the location, the condition, and availability of the
Equipment, additional services or features that can be added to a reservation
request at the Renter’s option (i.e., “add-ons”), and pricing and related rules
and financial terms. Gears will be made publicly available via the Platform.
Other Users will be able to book your Gear via the Platform based upon the
information provided in the Gear. You understand and agree that once a Renter
requests a reservation of your Gear, you may not request the Renter to pay a
higher price than in the reservation request.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>You
acknowledge and agree that you are responsible for any and all Gear profiles
you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Gear you post and the
reservation of, or a Renter’s use of, Equipment in a Gear profile you post: (i)
will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties,
such as ownership, lease or rental agreements; and (ii) will (a) be in
compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and
regulations that may apply to any Equipment included in a Gear profile you post
and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties. Please note that Sharingear
assumes no responsibility for an Owner’s compliance with any agreements with or
duties to third parties, applicable laws, rules and regulations. Sharingear
reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable
access to any Gear profile for any reason, including Gear profiles that Sharingear,
in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in
violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Platform.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>If you are
an Owner, you understand and agree that Sharingear does not act as an insurer
or as your contracting agent. If a Renter requests a reservation of your
Equipment and uses your Equipment, any agreement you enter into with such
Renter is between you and the Renter and Sharingear is not a party thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sharingear services as the limited authorized
payment collection agent of the Owner for the purposes of accepting, on behalf
of the Owner, payments from Renters of such amounts stipulated by the Owner
(including delivery or other fees and/or Taxes).</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>If you are
an Owner, Sharingear makes certain tools available to you to help you make
informed decisions about which Users you choose to approve for booking your
Equipment. You acknowledge and agree that, as an Owner, you are responsible for
your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions
of any individuals who may have access to the Equipment at your request or invitation,
excluding the Renter.</span></p>

<p><b><span

<p><b><span 
style='color:#262626'>6. No
Endorsement</span></b><span  style='color:#262626'> .</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Sharingear
does not endorse any User or any Equipment. Users are required by these Terms
to provide accurate information, and although Sharingear may undertake
additional checks and processes designed to help verify or check the identities
or backgrounds of users, we do not make any representations about, confirm, or
endorse any User or the User’s purported identity or background.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Any
references in the Platform to a User being “verified” or “connected” (or
similar language) only indicate that the User has completed a relevant
verification process and do not represent anything else. Any such description
is not an endorsement, certification or guarantee by Sharingear about any User,
including of the User’s identity and whether the User is trustworthy, safe, or
suitable. Instead, any such description is intended to be useful information
for you to evaluate when you make your own decisions about the identity and
suitability of others whom you contact or interact with via the Platform. We
recommend that you always exercise due diligence and care when deciding whether
to book from an Owner or accept a reservation request from a Renter, or to have
any other interaction with any other User. We are not responsible for any
damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Users.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>By using
the Platform, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to
obtain for actions and omissions of other Users or other third parties will be
limited to a claim against the particular Users or other third parties who
caused you harm. You agree not to attempt to impose liability on or seek any
legal remedy from Sharingear with respect to such actions or omissions.
Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Users on the
Platform regarding any reservations or Gears made by you. This limitation shall
not apply to any claim by an Owner against Sharingear regarding the remittance
of payments received from a Renter by Sharingear on behalf of an Owner, which
instead shall be subject to the limitations described in Section 18 below
(“Limitation of Liability”).</span></p>

<p><b><span 
style='color:#262626'>7.
Reservations and Financial Terms</span></b></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>Key
Definitions</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>-
“Equipment Fees” means the amounts that are due and payable by a Renter in
exchange for that Renter’s rental of Equipment, inclusive of any and all
“add-ons” (such as delivery or pick-up services) selected by the Renter. The
Owner alone, and not Sharingear, determines these amounts. The Owner may in his
or her sole discretion decide to include Taxes that the Owner determines that
he or she has to collect in connection with the reservation.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>- “Renter
Fees” means the fee that Sharingear charges a Renter for the use of its online
platform, which is calculated as a fixed percentage on top of the applicable
Equipment Fees. The Renter Fees will be displayed to the Renter when the Renter
is asked whether to send a reservation request to an Owner.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>- “Owner
Fees” means the fee that Sharingear charges an Owner for the use of its online
platform, which is calculated as a fixed percentage on top of the applicable
Equipment Fees. The Owner Fees will be displayed to the Owner when the Owner is
asked whether to approve or reject a reservation request from a prospective
Renter.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>- “Service
Fees” means collectively the User fees.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>- “Total
Fees” means collectively the Equipment Fees and the Renter Fees (plus any Taxes
in respect of Renter Fees).</span></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>Reservation
and Financial Terms for Owners</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>If you are
an Owner and a reservation is requested for your Equipment via the Platform,
you will be required to either approve or reject the reservation within 24
hours of when the reservation is requested (as determined by Sharingear in its
sole discretion) (the “Reservation Request Period”) or the reservation request
will be automatically cancelled. During the Reservation Request Period, until
the Owner either approves or rejects the reservation, the Gear will be in a
booked state and no other User may make a reservation request for the same days
and times, until the Owner either approves or rejects the pending reservation
request or the Reservation Request Period has expired. When a reservation for
your Equipment is requested via the Platform, we will share with you (i) the
first and last name of the Renter who has requested the reservation, (ii) a
link to the Renter’s Account profile page, (iii) the Renters address, and (iv)
if the Renter has requested delivery of the Equipment, the address where the
Equipment is requested to be delivered by the Owner, so that you can view such
information before approving or rejecting the reservation. If you are unable to
approve or decide to reject a reservation request of your Equipment within the
Reservation Request Period, the requested reservation will be cancelled by
Sharingear and the credit card will not be charged and any pre-authorization of
such credit card will be released, unless in Italy, Greece and Spain, the
pre-authorization has a particular running. In fact, the pre-authorized amount
is debited from the bank account. Pre-authorized funds are stored by the bank.
The user will get his/her funds back within 7 days. When you approve a
reservation requested by a Renter, the reservation is deemed confirmed, and
Sharingear will send you an email confirming such reservation.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Sharingear
will collect the Total Fees at the time of reservation confirmation (i.e., when
the Owner approves the reservation request) and will initiate payment of the
Equipment Fees (less Sharingear’s Owner Fees and any Taxes in respect of the
Owner Fees) to the Owner when the Owner receives the Equipment from Renter and
has checked it for any damage and has made the confirmation for receiving on
the Sharingear platform. The time it takes for the Owner to receive payouts may
depend upon the method for receiving payouts chosen by the Owner. Some methods
involve the use of third-party payment processors, who may impose their own
additional charges for the use of their services on the Owner, including by
deducting their charges from the payout amount.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>If you owe
or agree to pay any amount to Sharingear (whether as a result of your
reservations or actions as a Renter or otherwise), then Sharingear may (but is
not obligated to) withhold the amount owing to Sharingear from any payout
amounts due to you as an Owner and use the withheld amount to setoff the amount
owed by you to Sharingear. If Sharingear does so, then your obligation to pay Sharingear
will be extinguished to the extent of the amount withheld by Sharingear, and Sharingear
will cease to owe you any obligations, including, but not limited to, any
obligation to pay you, with respect to the amount withheld.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>Appointment
of Sharingear as Limited Payment Collection Agent for Owner</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Each Owner
hereby appoints Sharingear as the Owner’s limited payment collection agent
solely for the purposes of accepting the Equipment Fees from Renters.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Each Owner
agrees that payment made by a Renter through Sharingear shall be considered the
same as a payment made directly to the Owner, and the Owner will make the
Equipment available to the Renter in the agreed-upon manner as if the Owner has
received the Equipment Fees. Each Owner agrees that Sharingear may, in
accordance with the Sharingear cancellation policy set forth below
(“Cancellation and Refunds”), (i) permit the Renter to cancel the reservation
and (ii) refund to the Renter that portion of the Equipment Fees specified in
the applicable cancellation policy. Each Owner understands that as Sharingear
accepts payments from Renters as the Owner’s limited payment collection agent,
Sharingear’s obligation to pay the Owner is subject to and conditional upon Sharingear
successfully receiving the payments from Renters. Sharingear does not guarantee
payments to Owners for amounts that have not been successfully received from
Renters. In accepting appointment as the limited authorized agent of the Owner,
Sharingear assumes no liability for any acts or omissions of the Owner.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>If you are
an Owner, and as a condition of your appointment of Sharingear as your limited
payment collection agent, you understand that you may be deemed a sub-merchant
of Sharingear under its agreement with its third party payment service provider
and that you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third
party’s service and that third-party’s personal information collection
practices.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Please note
that Sharingear does not currently charge fees for the creation of Gear
profiles or to be a User. However, you as an Owner acknowledge and agree that Sharingear
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to charge you for and collect fees
from you for the creation of Gear profiles or for being a User. Please note
that Sharingear will provide notice of any Gear fee collection via the Platform
prior to implementing such a Gear fee feature.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>Reservations
and Financial Terms for Renters</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>The Owners,
not Sharingear, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed reservations
and making available any Equipment booked through the Platform. If you, as a
Renter, choose to enter into a transaction with an Owner for the reservation of
Equipment, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an
agreement with the Owner and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and
restrictions associated with such Equipment imposed by the Owner. You
acknowledge and agree that you, and not Sharingear, will be responsible for
performing the obligations of any such agreements, that Sharingear is not a
party to such agreements, and that, with the exception of its payment
obligations hereunder, Sharingear disclaims all liability arising from or
related to any such agreements. You further acknowledge and agree that,
notwithstanding the fact that Sharingear is not a party to the agreement
between you and the Owner, Sharingear acts as the Owner’s payment collection
agent for the limited purpose of accepting payments from you on behalf of the
Owner. Upon your payment of the Total Fees to Sharingear, your payment
obligation to the Owner for the Equipment Fees is extinguished, and Sharingear
is responsible for remitting the Equipment Fees (less Sharingear’s Owner Fees
and any Taxes in respect of the Owner Fees), in the manner described in these
Terms. In the event that Sharingear does not remit any such amounts as
described in these Terms, such Owner will have recourse only against Sharingear.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>The Total
Fees payable will be displayed to a Renter before the Renter sends a
reservation request to an Owner. As noted above, the Owner is required to
either approve or reject the reservation request within the Reservation Request
Period, otherwise the reservation request will be automatically cancelled. If a
reservation request is cancelled (i.e., not approved by the applicable Owner),
any amounts collected by Sharingear will be refunded to such Renter, depending
on the selections the Renter makes via the Site and/or Application, and any
pre-authorization of such Renter’s credit card will be released, if applicable</span></p>

<p><span

Renter, agree to pay Sharingear for the Total Fees for all reservations
requested in connection with your Sharingear Account if such requested
reservations are approved by the applicable Owner. In order to establish a
reservation pending the applicable Owner’s confirmation of your requested
reservation, you understand and agree that Sharingear, on behalf of the Owner,
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization
via your credit card for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your card a nominal
amount, not to exceed one ($1) dollar, or a similar sum in the currency in
which you are transacting (e.g., one euro or one British pound), to verify your
credit card. Once Sharingear receives approval of your reservation from the
applicable Owner, Sharingear will collect the Total Fees in accordance with
these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Gear profile. At
this time Sharingear may also collect the Security Deposit (defined below) or a
portion thereof, in its sole discretion. Please note that Sharingear cannot
control any fees that may be charged to a Renter by his or her bank related to
Sharingear’s collection of the Total Fees, and Sharingear disclaims all
liability in this regard.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>In
connection with your requested reservation, you will be asked to provide
customary billing information such as name, billing address, and credit card
information either to Sharingear or its third-party payment processor. You
agree to pay Sharingear for any approved reservations made in connection with
your Sharingear Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods
described on the Site or Application, e.g. by PayPal or credit card. You hereby
authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the credit card provided
as part of requesting the reservation, either by Sharingear or indirectly, via
a third-party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described
on the Site or Application. If you are directed to Sharingear’s third-party
payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of
that third party’s service and that third-party’s personal information
collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy
policy before using the services. Once your confirmed reservation transaction
is complete, you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed
reservation.</span></p>

Deposits</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Sharingear
chooses to include a security deposit in the reservation billing (“Security
Deposits”), based on a fixed amount of the actual value of the respective
Equipment in the Gear profile. Each reservation billing will describe the
Security Deposit amount as a fixed percentage of the value of each respective
Equipment. Sharingear will, in its capacity as the payment collection agent of
the Owner, use its commercially reasonable efforts to either: (i) charge the
Renter’s credit card at the time of reservation confirmation the Security
Deposit amount, or (ii) obtain a pre-authorization of the Renter’s credit card
in the amount of the Security Deposit, at the time of reservation confirmation
or within a reasonable time prior to the Renter’s use of the Owner’s Equipment.
Sharingear will also use its commercially reasonable efforts to address Owner’s
requests and claims related to Security Deposits, but Sharingear is not
responsible for administering or accepting any claims by Owners related to
Security Deposits and disclaims any and all liability in this regard.</span></p>

(iii) special amenities or features represented in the Gear description are not

listed by you and (ii) Sharingear either reimburses that Renter any amount up
to the amount paid by the Renter through the Platform for the Equipment or

request. You also agree that in order for you to reimburse Sharingear up to the
amount paid by Sharingear, Sharingear may off-set or reduce any amounts owed by
Sharingear to you by this amount. If the Renter uses the Equipment for part or
all of the reservation despite the Equipment Issue, the Renter may receive a
refund that will reduce the amount of the Equipment Fees ultimately paid to
you. If the Renter uses alternative Equipment, you may lose part or all of the
Equipment Fee payment for the reservation and you may be responsible for
reasonable additional costs incurred in order for the Renter to use the

Renter prior to disputing the Equipment Issue claim. In the event of one or
more Equipment Issues, Sharingear, in its discretion, may elect to take
additional actions, including, without limitation, negatively affecting your Gear
profile ranking, automated reviews indicating Equipment Issues, cancelling
future reservations, suspending or removing the Gear profile of the Equipment
or imposing penalties or fees for the administrative burden associated with the
Equipment Issue. All determinations of Sharingear with respect to Equipment
Issue claims, including without limitation the size of any refund to the
Renter, shall be final and binding on the Renters and Owners.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>In certain
circumstances, Sharingear may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is
necessary or desirable to cancel a confirmed reservation made via the Platform
and override the cancellation policy applicable to such reservation, in whole
or in part. Such circumstances include death in the Owner’s or Renter’s family,
serious illness of the Renter or Renter’s family User, natural disaster in the
country where the Equipment is located, political unrest in the country where
the Equipment is located, jury duty other similar civil obligations, or for any
other reason, contingent in all cases on proper documentation, where valid.</span></p>

<p><u><span 
style='color:#262626'>Rounding
Off</span></u></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Sharingear
may, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payable
from or to Renters or Owners to the nearest whole functional base unit in which
the currency is denominated (e.g., to the nearest dollar, euro, or other
supported currency); for example, Sharingear may round up an amount of €101.50
to €102.00, and €101.49 to €101.00.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Some
currencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Sharingear may
determine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated to
be 10, 100, or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for such
currencies would be for Sharingear to round up an amount of 2,025 up to 2,030
and 2,024 down to 2,020, or 48,750 to you 48,700 and 48,749 down to 48,700, or
675,500 up to 676,000 and 675,499 down to 675,000.</span></p>

<p><u><span 
style='color:#262626'>Donations</span></u></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Some Owners
may pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmed
reservations made via the Platform to a particular cause or charity. Sharingear
does not control, and will not take any responsibility or liability for,
whether the Owner does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make.</span></p>

<p><u><span 
style='color:#262626'>Taxes</span></u></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>Tax
regulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from our
Owners, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Owners, or both. For instance, IRS
regulations may stipulate that Sharingear must collect IRS Form W-9 from US
Owners or an appropriate IRS Form W-8 from non-US Owners with at least one Gear
profile in the US. You as an Owner are solely responsible for keeping the
information in your tax forms current, complete, and accurate. If you as an
Owner fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficient
to alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold payments to you (e.g., where
you are a US Owner and you fail to provide us with a completed IRS Form W-9),
we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you until
resolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</span></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>You as an
Owner understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i)
your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should be
included, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating to
applicable Taxes in Gears. You are also solely responsible for remitting to the
relevant authority any Taxes included or received by you. Sharingear cannot and
does not offer Tax-related advice to any Users.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>Assignment</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>You may not
assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without Sharingear’s
prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms,
without such consent, will be null and of no effect. Sharingear may assign or
transfer these Terms, at its sole discretion, without restriction. Subject to
the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties,

Law and Jurisdiction</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>These Terms
will be interpreted in accordance with the laws of Denmark, without regard to
its conflict of law provisions. You and we submit to the personal jurisdiction
or federal court in Copenhagen, Denmark for any actions for which the parties
retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of
competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement,
misappropriation, or violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade
secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights, as set forth in the
Dispute Resolution provision below.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>Dispute
Resolution</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>You and Sharingear
agree that any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to
these Terms or the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or
validity thereof, or to the use of the Platform (collectively, “Disputes”) will
be settled by binding arbitration, except that each party retains the right to
seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction
to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or
violation of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other
intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you and Sharingear
are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff
or class User in any purported class action or representative proceeding.
Further, unless both you and Sharingear otherwise agree in writing, the
arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims and may not
otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If
this specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this
“Dispute Resolution” section will be deemed void.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>Survival</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>The
provisions and terms of these Terms that by their nature should survive
termination of these Terms, including, without limitation, the “Dispute
Resolution” section and Section 18 (“Limitation of Liability”), shall survive
any termination or expiration of these Terms.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span 
style='color:#262626'>General</span></i></b></p>

<p><span 
style='color:#262626'>The failure
of Sharingear to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not
constitute a waiver of future enforcement of that right or provision. The
waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and
signed by a duly authorized representative of Sharingear. Except as expressly
set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies
under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these
Terms or otherwise. If for any reason an arbitrator or a court of competent
jurisdiction finds any provision of these Terms invalid or unenforceable, that
provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other
provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</span></p>
