<span>                <a href="mailto:support@sharingear.com"> <span style=''>support@sharingear.com</span>
</a>            </span> <span>.</span></p>

<p><span>If, as anOwner, you cancel a confirmed reservation, Sharingear may apply penalties orconsequences to you or your Gear profile, including (i) publishing an automatedreview on your Gear profile indicating that a reservation was cancelled, (ii)keeping the calendar for your Gear unavailable or blocked for the dates of thecancelled reservation, or (iii) imposing a cancellation fee (to be withheldfrom your future payouts). You will be notified of the situations in which acancellation fee applies before you decide to cancel.</span>
</p>

<p><span>If, as aRenter, you want to cancel a reservation due to an Equipment Issue (definedbelow), within twenty-four hours after the start of your reservation, we agree,at our discretion, to use our reasonable efforts to find and book you otherEquipment for the time left in your reservation which in our determination isreasonably comparable to the Equipment described in your original reservationin terms of type, features, and quality. All determinations of Sharingear withrespect to refunds requested related to Equipment Issues, including withoutlimitation the size of any refund, shall be final and binding on the Rentersand Owners. An “Equipment Issue” means any one of the following: (a) the Ownerof the Equipment (i) cancels a reservation shortly before the scheduled startof the reservation, or (ii) fails to provide the Renter with the reasonableability to access the Equipment; or (b) the description of the Equipment in theGear profile on the Site is materially inaccurate with respect to: (i) the makeand/or model of the Equipment, (ii) the condition of the Equipment, to theextent it affects the Renter’s ability to utilize the Equipment as intended,(iii) special amenities or features represented in the Gear description are notprovided or do not function, or (iv) the physical location of the Equipment(proximity). Only a Renter may submit a claim for an Equipment Issue. To submita claim: (a) You must bring the Equipment Issue to our attention in writing to </span>
<span>                <a href="mailto:support@sharingear.com"> <span style=''>support@sharingear.com</span>
</a>            </span> <span>and provide us with information, including photographs or other evidence, aboutthe Equipment and the circumstances of the Equipment Issue, within twenty-four(24) hours after the start of your reservation, and must respond to anyrequests by us for additional information or cooperation on the EquipmentIssue; (b) you must not have directly or indirectly caused the Equipment Issue(through your action, omission, or negligence); and (c) you must have usedreasonable efforts to try and remedy the circumstances of the Equipment Issuewith the Owner prior to making a claim for an Equipment Issue.</span>
</p>

<p><span>If you arean Owner, you are responsible for ensuring that the Equipment you list on theSite meets minimum quality standards regarding access, adequacy of thedescription on the Site, and does not present a Renter with Equipment Issues.During the 24-hour period after the start of a Renter’s reservation, Ownersshould be available, or make a third-party available, in order to try, in goodfaith, to resolve Equipment Issues. If you are an Owner, and if (i) Sharingeardetermines that a Renter has suffered an Equipment Issue related to Equipmentlisted by you and (ii) Sharingear either reimburses that Renter any amount upto the amount paid by the Renter through the Platform for the Equipment orprovides alternative Equipment to the Renter, you agree to reimburse Sharingearup to the amount paid by Sharingear within thirty (30) days of Sharingear’srequest. You also agree that in order for you to reimburse Sharingear up to theamount paid by Sharingear, Sharingear may off-set or reduce any amounts owed bySharingear to you by this amount. If the Renter uses the Equipment for part orall of the reservation despite the Equipment Issue, the Renter may receive arefund that will reduce the amount of the Equipment Fees ultimately paid toyou. If the Renter uses alternative Equipment, you may lose part or all of theEquipment Fee payment for the reservation and you may be responsible forreasonable additional costs incurred in order for the Renter to use thealternate Equipment. The rights of the Renters relating to Equipment Issuessupersedes the Sharingear cancellation policy or the cancellation policy set bythe Owner, if any. If you dispute the Equipment Issue, you may notify us inwriting to </span>
<span>                <a href="mailto:support@sharingear.com"> <span style=''>support@sharingear.com</span>
</a>            </span> <span>and provide us with information, including photographs or other evidence,disputing the claims regarding the Equipment Issue, provided you must have usedreasonable and good faith efforts to try to remedy the Equipment Issue with theRenter prior to disputing the Equipment Issue claim. In the event of one ormore Equipment Issues, Sharingear, in its discretion, may elect to takeadditional actions, including, without limitation, negatively affecting your Gearprofile ranking, automated reviews indicating Equipment Issues, cancellingfuture reservations, suspending or removing the Gear profile of the Equipmentor imposing penalties or fees for the administrative burden associated with theEquipment Issue. All determinations of Sharingear with respect to EquipmentIssue claims, including without limitation the size of any refund to theRenter, shall be final and binding on the Renters and Owners.</span>
</p>

<p><span>In certaincircumstances, Sharingear may decide, in its sole discretion, that it is necessaryor desirable to cancel a confirmed reservation made via the Platform andoverride the cancellation policy applicable to such reservation, in whole or inpart. Such circumstances include death in the Owner’s or Renter’s family,serious illness of the Renter or Renter’s family member, natural disaster inthe country where the Equipment is located, political unrest in the countrywhere the Equipment is located, jury duty other similar civil obligations, orfor any other reason, contingent in all cases on proper documentation, wherevalid.</span>
</p>

<p><u> <span>RoundingOff</span> </u></p>

<p><span>Sharingearmay, in its sole discretion, round up or round down amounts that are payablefrom or to Renters or Owners to the nearest whole functional base unit in whichthe currency is denominated (e.g., to the nearest dollar, euro, or othersupported currency); for example, Sharingear may round up an amount of €101.50to €102.00, and €101.49 to €101.00.</span>
</p>

<p><span>Somecurrencies are denominated in large numbers. In those cases, Sharingear maydetermine the functional base unit in which those currencies are denominated tobe 10, 100, or 1,000 of the currency; the corresponding examples for suchcurrencies would be for Sharingear to round up an amount of 2,025 up to 2,030and 2,024 down to 2,020, or 48,750 to you 48,700 and 48,749 down to 48,700, or675,500 up to 676,000 and 675,499 down to 675,000.</span>

<p><u> <span>Donations</span> </u></p>

<p><span>Some Ownersmay pledge to donate a portion of the funds they receive from confirmedreservations made via the Platform to a particular cause or charity. Sharingeardoes not control, and will not take any responsibility or liability for,whether the Owner does in fact make the donation he or she pledged to make.</span>
</p>

<p><u> <span>Taxes</span> </u></p>

<p><span>Taxregulations may require us to collect appropriate tax information from ourOwners, or to withhold taxes from payouts to Owners, or both. For instance, IRSregulations may stipulate that Sharingear must collect IRS Form W-9 from USOwners or an appropriate IRS Form W-8 from non-US Owners with at least one Gearprofile in the US. You as an Owner are solely responsible for keeping theinformation in your tax forms current, complete, and accurate. If you as anOwner fail to provide us with documentation that we determine to be sufficientto alleviate our obligation (if any) to withhold payments to you (e.g., whereyou are a US Owner and you fail to provide us with a completed IRS Form W-9),we reserve the right in our sole discretion to freeze all payouts to you untilresolution, to withhold such amounts as required by law, or to do both.</span>
</p>

<p><span>You as anOwner understand and agree that you are solely responsible for determining (i)your applicable Tax reporting requirements, and (ii) the Taxes that should beincluded, and for including Taxes to be collected or obligations relating toapplicable Taxes in Gears.
